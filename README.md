hello!! 
I just made my first laravel project!! and it was a hell of a task!
as a beginner it all seems so overwhelming at first but I'm sure this is going to be fun!
chatgpt and gemini assisted me in this whole process but i will try to create next projects on my own!
I made a simple todo app which creates tasks, adds them, deletes them and marks them as completed!
